## Daily Coding Problem Solutions

### Contact: Mark May (markamay@live.com)

### Description

Daily Coding Problem is a website that will send you a programming problem everyday by email.
These programming problems are usually interview questions asked by top companies. This repository
is going to store my solutions to these problems. The language I write in may vary (although right now I'm mainly using C++). You can
sign up to receive problems for free at https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/

### Solutions

Descriptions of the problems I have completed can be found in [ProblemDescriptions.md](./ProblemDescriptions.md). There are links to the solutions there or you can go directly in the [src folder](./src). I am working on getting up to date with all the problems I have received so far. I signed up for the daily problems awhile back and forgot about it until recently.  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding my solution to a problem please feel free to let me know. I'm always happy for feedback.

#### Usage
A makefile is provided to make compiling my solutions easier. To compile a specific solution enter the problem number as a target to make. For example, to compile the solution to problem 89 you would enter:
```
make 89
```
